# Micro Service
# Using .Net Core, Docker, Kubernetes, Sql Server, RabbitMQ, gRPC
### Platform Service - Command Service

This is a [Micro Service Project] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgVjEo3OGBI&t=4s) project bootstrapped with [`.Net Core`](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

Open [http://localhost:44394](http://localhost:44394) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:44394/swagger](http://localhost:44394/swagger). This endpoint can be edited in `Controller/PlatformsController.ts`.

The `Controller` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/introduction).

## Learn More
